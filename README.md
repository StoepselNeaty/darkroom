With a photographer friend, I am developing webtools to help kids understand photography fundamentals. We started with the darkroom. (Inspired by Brett Victor, what a guy.) This project in unfinished and in development.

glb.{html,pde}: uses the processing.min.js javascript library. I want to avoid being prescriptive and start with a problem which the student-user must solve instead. On this page, the idea is that the student has an undeveloped role of film and must figure out how to develop it in the darkroom. The first task in this endeavour is to know in which order to use the darkroom tools.

glb.rkt: I often hash out computations in racket before I implement them in another language. I do this because I find racket intuitive and simple. This is an example of such a computational draft for the processing code mentioned above.
